                Join the late Mr. Stretch on his quest to reclaim his fortune, stolen from him by an old enemy that Mr. Stretch can't quite remember. Mr. Stretch must return to his old manor and gather up all of his treasure so that he can return it to his tomb and bask in its brilliance. There must be more than meets the eye to this theft, but Mr. Stretch's memory is getting foggy as he grows older. All Mr. Stretch knows is that he'll do anything to get his fortune back.<br>
                Stretch from platform to platform to reclaim your treasure and move to the exit to escape before the assorted spooks can steal it back.<br>
                Uncover Secrets about the past and present by collecting elusive journal pages.<br>
                Beat the game the hard way by puzzling out gem combos and besting par scores.<br>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>
                “Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune” is Muketronics debuting game and began development in 2022 in SMBX. Mr. Stretch was then ported to Unity so that it could be monetized. A demo was released in 2023, and the game is planned to enter early access in 2024.<br>
                “Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune” is the first game in the Mr. Stretch franchise. Several Mr. stretch games are planned, including: “Mr. Stretch and the Infernal Machine” (Mr. Stretch Pinball), “Mr. Stretch and the False Afterlife” (Mr. Stretch 2), and “Dr. Stretch” (Mr. Stretch Pre-mortem). The development of these games depends on the success of  “Mr. Stretch and the Stolen fortune.
