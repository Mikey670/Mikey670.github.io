            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>“Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune” is Muketronics’ debuting game. It began development in 2022 as a custom episode in SMBX, but its scope quickly outgrew this environment. After the first world competed development, Mr. Stretch was ported to Unity, which entailed rewriting all of the code.</p>
            <p>While Mr. Stretch was being ported to Unity, the game’s design and art underwent a massive overhaul, the story became more fleshed out and the colors used greatly improved.</p>
            <p>After the unity port was finished, a demo was published in 2023. The demo has undergone several updates since then in an attempt to improve issues discovered by users.</p>
            <p>Because Mr. Stretch is Muketronics’ first game, it’s grown along with the team members, finding several opportunities to improve along the way. Because of the developer’s inexperience developing games, Mr. Stretch is planned to enter early access in 2024 so that they can receive more input.</p>
            <h2>Mr. Stretch as a Franchise</h2>
            <p>“Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune” is only the first game in Muketronics’ flagship franchise, and depending on its success, the following games are planned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Mr. Stretch and the Infernal Machine” (Mr. Stretch Pinball Spin-off)</li>
                <li>“Mr. Stretch and the False Afterlife” (Mr. Stretch 2)</li>
                <li>“Dr. Stretch” (Mr. Stretch Prequel)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Inspirations</h2>
            <p>The gameplay of Mr. Stretch is heavily inspired by Nitrome’s “Silly Sausage”, the player character moving in an almost identical fashion. Mr. Stretch builds on “Silly Sausages” gameplay with a unique point system that requires the player to collect gems in a specific order to achieve par score on every level.</p>
            <p>Some players have noted the player characters’ similarities to “Super Mario Worlds” Stretcher Boo, and this is no coincidence. Mr. Stretch was originally a character for an SMBX episode, so the developers thought it would be fitting for him to be a Boo. While Mr. Stretches appearance has changed, he is still commonly accused of being a Boo. The SMBX version of Mr. Stretch can still be found on the internet.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stretch also takes inspiration from “Indiana Jones”, the main character being an archeologist of great success. Mr. Stretch has a worse reputation than Indiana, being known for his greediness, cowardice, and selfish nature.</p>
