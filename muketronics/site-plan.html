      <h3>Purpose</h3>

The website will contain information about all of our games, be those that are currently in development, or ones that are already published. The website will feature links to where these games can be purchased, downloaded, or even played online. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience will be young adults who like to play video games. Most people who will enjoy the game that I am developing will have prior experience playing video games.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        “Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune” is Muketronics debuting game and began development in 2022 in SMBX. Mr. Stretch was then ported to Unity so that it could be monetized. A demo was released in 2023, and the game is planned to enter early access in 2024.<br>
        “Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune” is the first game in the Mr. Stretch franchise. Several Mr. stretch games are planned, including: “Mr. Stretch and the Infernal Machine” (Mr. Stretch Pinball), “Mr. Stretch and the False Afterlife” (Mr. Stretch 2), and “Dr. Stretch” (Mr. Stretch Pre-mortem). The development of these games depends on the success of “Mr. Stretch and the Stolen fortune.

        The home page will have text pop-ups that spring out from behind the game images when the user hovers over them.

        Below all of the things on the wireframe there will be a picture gallary of pictures from the game. The game imbed will not be shown on the phone version because it will not work. This page will also serve as a blueprint for future game pages.
