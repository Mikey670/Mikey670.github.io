        <h2>Mike Knight</h2>
        <h2>AKA "Mukey"</h2>
        <p>I am the owner of a small idependent video game production company, Muketronics, but I don't really know how to program, so I'm going to school to learn how!</p>
        <p>I'm currently the artist and designer of the game 'Mr. Stretch and the Stolen Fortune' (demo available now on Steam), and an unpublished novelist. I spend my freetime playing video games, reading, drawing, writing, and playing board games.</p>
        <p>After I finish my Computer Science degree, I'm going to get rich developing cool games so that I can support my future family, but I'm single, so if you have any pretty sisters, cousin-ettes, or neigbor-ettes, put in a good word for me!</p>
